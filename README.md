# Shaka's Portfolio

An interactive, Windows XP styled portfolio for **Shaka Nathan K**, developer, AI engineer and project lead based in Kampala, Uganda. A short typed boot hands over to a scrolling XP desktop: About opens on arrival, case studies live in an Explorer folder with silent walkthrough videos, and Merlin waits in the corner until you click him.

## What it is

- **Boot**: about 0.9s of typed diagnostics, then the desktop. Esc or Enter skips it, and `fastboot` or reduced motion goes straight to the desktop.
- **Desktop**: files on the left, a photo and a sticky note top-right, a skills orbit below the fold. The taskbar and wallpaper stay fixed while the desktop scrolls.
- **Windows**: About, Case Studies, the case study viewer, Hire Me, My Approach.txt, Terminal, Device and Credits, all sharing one XP Luna window shell.
- **Terminal**: an in-browser shell (`xterm.js` plus `@zenfs/core`) with `help`, `ls`, `neofetch`, `whoami`, `skills` and `socials`.
- **Merlin**: a clippyts assistant with a docked chat window and its own taskbar button.

## Tech stack

React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5, Tailwind 3, framer-motion 10, react-draggable, react-icons, simple-icons, windups, xterm.js, @zenfs/core, clippyts, and @fontsource for Fira Sans, Fira Mono, Bricolage Grotesque and Caveat.
